## Cub3D
The main task in Cub3D is to create a basic 3D maze-like game where the player can move around in a first-person view.
The project emphasizes the use of raycasting to render a pseudo-3D environment from a 2D map.
You will also need to handle basic player movement, collision detection, and simple textures to make the environment look realistic.
